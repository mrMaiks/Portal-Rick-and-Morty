<h1 align="center">The multiverse and worlds are waiting for you!</h1>
<h3 align="center">Create a Rick gun from the animated series Rick and Morty, and go on an adventure.</h3>
<p>In this mod, you will have the opportunity to navigate through the dimensions by simply writing their ID in the input field.</p>
<p>But wait, you need to do it first.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for the sake of balance, the cannon can only be obtained after killing the final boss of minecraft - Ender Dragon!</p>
<p>By collecting his breath, and combining it on a potion maker with a crystal that you can find under the ground of the mushroom islands. You will receive a solution.</p>
<p>Next, you will need to connect: an enchanted golden apple, a block of red stone, a bar of nezerite, and a star of the edge. To get a memory card!</p>
<p>It's just a small matter, you need to find a traveling merchant, and hope that he sells "Mathematical calculations". The price is high, but it's worth it.</p>
<p>And so, by combining all the ingredients with two iron blocks, you will receive the coveted cannon.</p>
<h3 align="center">How to use it?</h3>
<p>Press "h" on your keyboard while holding the portal cannon in your hands. You will have an interface in which you can write the id of any dimension, and it doesn't matter if it's from a simple minecraft or the modifications you downloaded.</p>
<h3 align="center">The charges at the cannon</h3>
<p>The cannon has only 10 charges. After they run out, the cannon will become unusable. To replenish the charge, take the discharged portal cannon in your left hand (additional) and the "Quantum Transport Solution" in the main one, press the right mouse button, and wait.<p>
